float32	dca_amplitude				# The amplitude (uq12.4) that is evaluated and used in the DCA module.

uint32[<=132]	data					# Raw x-y-sorted ADC results from the device.
									# The raw data contains the saturation flag which are the two MSBs which
									# might need to be removed via the 0x3FFFFFU mask:
									# sample = Data[i] & 0x3FFFFFU;.
									# Additionally, the values may need to be normalized to a single digital
									# integration pattern by dividing with the digital integration depth
									# (see #argus_meas_frame_t.DigitalIntegrationDepth):
									# sample_normalized = Data[i] / res->Frame.DigitalIntegrationDepth;
									# Data is arranged as 32-bit values in following order:
									# index > phase; where index is pixel number n and auxiliary ADC channel.
									# Note that disabled pixels are skipped.
									# e.g. [n=0,p=0][n=0,p=1]..[n=0,p=3][n=1,p=0]...[n=1,p=3]...[n=31,p=3]


ArgusXTalk[<=2]	x_talk_predictor	# The current crosstalk correction values as determined by the
									# crosstalk predictor algorithm. This is basically the temperature
									# dependent portion of the crosstalk correction.
									# Note that there are two values for the upper and lower two rows
									# respectively.


ArgusXTalk[<=4]	x_talk_monitor		# The current crosstalk correction values as determined by the
									# crosstalk monitor algorithm. This is a dynamic portion of the
									# crosstalk correction that is determined by monitoring passive pixels.
									# Note that the values are valid row-wise.
